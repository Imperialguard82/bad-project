<p>The gluten free diet is very helpful for suffers of IBS with celiac disease, non-celiac gluten sensitivity and wheat allergy. You will find there is a bit of a cross over with the gluten free diet and the FODMAP diet as many gluten free foods are useful when doing the restrictive FODMAP diet. If you have had a diagnosis of having coeliac disease or have found you have a sensitivity or allergic reactions to gluten or wheat, then it is advisable to follow a gluten free diet.</br>
Be sure to look at the labels – these days’ labels will label whether they have gluten within them so pay particular attention to them. If you find the label says there is gluten or has been processed in an environment that may have traces of gluten, then trust the label and do not consume that item. Gluten free foods is defined as foods containing less than 20 parts per million (ppm) of gluten.</br>
Surprisingly, a good place to find a lot of good gluten free foods is Amazon UK. Have a browse and you can find a lot of foods tailored to a gluten free diet that you wouldnot have thought you could not have again such as gluten free cakes and pasta.</br>

<p>Gluten refers to the proteins found in cereal grain’s endosperm (a type of tissue produced in seeds that are ground to make flour). Gluten is used to nourish plant embryos during germination. Gluten is actually composed of two different proteins: gliadin (a protamine protein) and glutenin (a glutelin protein). Though “true gluten” is sometimes defined as being specific to wheat, gluten is also found in barley and rye.  Gluten is also found in hybrids of wheat such as spelt, kamut, and triticale.</br> 
When flour is mixed with water, the gluten proteins form a sticky network that has a glue-like consistency.  This glue-like property makes the dough elastic, and gives bread the ability to rise when baked. It also provides a chewy, satisfying texture.  The elasticity of gluten also allows dough to trap air bubbles when rising making baked bread light and fluffy.</br>
Interestingly, the name glu-ten is derived from this glue-like property of wet dough.</br>
