The other ReadMe called: Default README.md is the default cloud9 ReadMe

The link to the project Cloud9 development location is: https://ide.c9.io/imperialguard82/bad_project

Getting onto the database:
The database is accessible through this link: https://bad-project-imperialguard82.c9users.io/phpmyadmin
If phpmadmin is not installed (it should be) then run this command: phpmyadmin-ctl install
To login to phpmyadmin the Name is imperialguard82 and then there is no password.


Actually using the website:
The website has no login or register function.
The map page only links back to the home page due to issues with creating the home page.
The list page does not have any special searching methods and is just a list
The map page has a number of locations, clicking on a location will both pan to that location and zoom in.
Each location has a textbox containing the name of the location, its address and what kinds of foods it sells.

Using the database:
The gluten free foods list will get longer when you add new food items to it either via the command line or 
directly from phpmyadmin

Side Note:
For some reason the command line will no longer accept updates to the locations table so any new changes have to be
made using the insert command on phpmyadmin.
